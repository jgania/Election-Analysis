# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this audit was to challenge my knowlege of python to create a script that could calculate the the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout using a csv file. This challenge includes the use of python script, for loops, if statements, and scripted calculations to display and analyse data.

## Election-Audit Results
### Total Votes: 369,711
### County Results
-Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
-Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
-Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
### Largest County Turnout: Denver County
### Candidate Results
-Charles Casper Stockman: 23.0% (85,213)
-Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
-Raymond Anthonty Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
### Winning Candidate: Diana DeGette

## Election-Audit Summary: This script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. As long as the CSV files profided are in the same three column format, this script will work for any election data. It can be expanded on if needed to account for larger pools of data and multiple other categories by creating additional for loops to interate through additional columns.
